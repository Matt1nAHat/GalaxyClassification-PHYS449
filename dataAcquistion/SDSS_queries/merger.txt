For merger galaxies, the following query was used:

SELECT TOP 1000
g.objid, zns.nvote,
zns.p_el as elliptical,
zns.p_cw as spiralclock, zns.p_acw as spiralanticlock, zns.p_edge as edgeon,
zns.p_dk as dontknow, zns.p_mg as merger
FROM Galaxy as G
JOIN ZooNoSpec AS zns
ON G.objid = zns.objid
WHERE g.clean=1 and zns.nvote >= 10 and zns.p_mg > 0.8
